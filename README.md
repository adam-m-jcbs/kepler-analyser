Welcome to the Kepler model analysis routine
============================================

Author: Nathanael Lampe

What is it?

KEPLER is a 1-D hydrodynamics code that is used to simulate type 1
x-ray bursts. The analysis routines here opens KEPLER lightcurves
(in ASCII format) and analyses them, producing separated x-ray 
bursts from the burst trains provided as an input. It then returns
summary tables of individual burst properties, as well as global 
properties for each burst.


How do I use it?

This script was designed for *Python 2.7*

You'll need the following Python packages too
 * lmfit
 * Scipy
 * Numpy
 * Bottleneck
